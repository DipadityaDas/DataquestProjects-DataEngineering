    "# Implementing a Key-Value Database\n",
    "In this short project, we will be using the b-tree data structure as the building block for a fully functioning, saving-to-disk, key-value store. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will have a data engineering focus and thus different data structures and efficiency will be key. For an analysis focused project, look for some database projects in the Data Analysis Github repo."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "A key-value store is a database that operates similar to a Python dictionary but stored in a file. There are the important get and set methods that the dictionary contains, but the key-value store will also provide an API for saving to disk, loading from disk, range queries of our data, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal will be to create an easy to use, flexible, and adaptable key value store that other developers could use in their projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple implementations of the key-value store that are used in production grade systems worldwide. Some example open source implementations are Redis, CouchDB, Mongo, and Cassandra (which uses a b-tree as the underlying datastructure). These are just a few of the major projects that implement a key-value store that is similar to the one we will be creating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful though; just because we have the same underlying data structure does not mean that our project is production ready. These types of projects have to cater to multiple use cases, are robust and well tested, but the most important is a well defined and easy to use API. In order to be in the same tier, our project has to most certainly have good API design, and we won't get there building a general case. This is why a perfect \"sample\" project does not exist, and most times we must build to cater to specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that being said, for this project, we will inherit the majority of the behavior from the BTree structure. However, we will redesign some of the API to make it more user friendly. Finally, we will be implementing some additional behavior to make it function as the key-value database that we expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will note that the project itself will be very short in code, and this is not a bad thing! Good design can often very well result in small code, which makes it easy to read, and easy to use. Because this project has a data engineering focus, this is exactly what we want."

    "## Implementing the Get and the Set\n",
    "Every key-value store (abbreviated to kv store) implements a get() and set() method that serve as its most important functionality. Like a Python dict, the kv store will set a value for some given key only if value is not None. However, the set() method should also function different from a Python dictionary by requiring the uniqueness of the key, that means if the key exists in the kv store, then throw a duplicate error.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the get() method, we also want to replicate the same behavior from the Python dictionary. If we wish to get() the value for some given key, then we should get the saved value. However, if that key does not exist, the key-value store should throw an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important thing to remember is to always think about the API design as we develop the get() and set() methods. A handy class to use is the NodeKey class that is attached to the project file. With this class, we try to make it so the user of the kv store does not have to create a NodeKey objects first before calling set() on the kv store. Below is the first implementation of the project:"

    "## Possible Features\n",
    "A few additional features you could provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enhancing the API and making it look more \"Pythonic\" using special methods for set and get. (This is really more of a aesthetic thing rather than a efficiency thing - but often times better looking code can still result in the latter.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* A different serializer so that you can use different versions of Python. (Something like JSON might work here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* A delete method that would remove nodes from the kv store. (This is an efficiency improvement that would work if you needed something that was more flowing. Instead of dumping and loading all at once, perhaps you are in need of just removing a couple nodes. This will essentially work similar but opposite to a set.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Saving out to multiple files using the keys as pointers to files for bigger databases. (This would be a good use if your file ends up being too big (ours obviously isn't). The code will have the same foundation except now you will need to obviously insert more than one file name and the db will be split in certain areas.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implementing the kv store on top of a B+Tree, another variation of the b-tree family of data structures. (This is one of those different strokes for different folks type situations - the BTree works fine, but a B+Tree might be better depending on your preference and situation. B+Tree: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that all these are just a sample of the things that you can do with the kv store. The possibilities are literally endless, and if your situation calls for it, more likely than not, you can do it!\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to note that Python itself and its primitive libraries should not be underestimated. Open source code is open source for a reason - for the best minds to work on and improve things. If a method, function, or class already exists that you are trying to add, it's probably best to not re-invent the wheel."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this project, we highlighted the inner workings of a KV key-value database class that used attributes of a BTree. We used helper code that can be viewed in their respective files within this directory. We also added various methods such as a getter, setter, load, dump, range_query, etc. to the class that proved to be very helpful when a user is writing code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your situation and what you need, this code can actually be used as a basis for an actual use case for a specific KV database that you need in industry. In a truly individualized and customized database, the code will be very similar to many other classes, but never the same. This is a blessing that must be recognized; often times improving on existing work comes from small tweaks here and there, but the foundation stays the same. Complete overhauls are rarely necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project was a very nice showing of how basic b-trees work and a basic key-value database in action. A b-tree is one of the more complex data structures, but once mastered, it can seem as basic as anything else. As far as data engineering goes, like it is always said, practice makes perfect."
